# Notes:
# - This CI workflow builds both the backend (basic checks) and the frontend (production build).
# - For continuous deployment to Vercel and Render, connect this GitHub repository to Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend) via their dashboards.
#   Both services can be configured to automatically deploy on pushes to the `main` branch. That approach is simpler and more secure
#   than embedding deployment API keys into workflow files here.
